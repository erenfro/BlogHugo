# Beginning A New Path

So I decided with the DisplayPort issue, it might be time for a new change in the way I do things. I've basically at this point fully upgraded my computer, new case, new water cooling system, 64GB RAM, and most importantly, new GPU that can actually perform quite amazing.

Sooo, I've embarked on a new journey, and started tinkering with Manjaro Linux. I didn't want actual Arch Linux on my desktop, because I do know it can be... problematic being always bleeding edge current. And I know Manjaro does hold back updates in part for this very reason. 

Well, to be honest, it was a pretty decent distro these days as well. Very basic with the XFCE setup though, but it was there, and it worked. A friend of mine however suggested another distro, one I'd kind of heard of, but thought, eh.. It's just another Arch Linux fork. He suggested GarudaLinux, and my friend he's also in podcast and happened to do a show about it here:

[Fork Bomb: Garuda](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fork-bomb-technology-and-other-nerdy-retro-stuff/id1189930894?i=1000536309662)

So I listened to it. I know one guy he's fairly good with Linux, and the other guy, well, not so much, and you can kind of tell if you yourself are knowledgable enough as well. I decided to give it a try, since well, I was curious, especially about this Linux-zen kernel, this Garuda Gamer, peformance tweaks, etc.

Of course, you know what edition I chose, XFCE edition. :)

So, I have to say, I'm impressed with the custom design of the software that's made for it. I wouldn't say absolutely it's the most impressive software in the whole world, but it's there, it does what it was designed to do, and provides a very helpful means to setup a large variety of software packages, services, and more.

So, ultimately I installed Garuda on my desktop fully replacing Fedora for the first time in 9 years. BTW, I still hate Arch Linux, but I fear this may end up growing on me the way this has been thus far. Will it break? I'm sure it will. But I do have snapshots and a reasonable amount of understanding of how to fix many things.

So, we will see...
